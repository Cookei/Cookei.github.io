        <h1 class = "name">My name is Han Li</h1>
        <p>I am currently a junior in high school aiming to delve into the field of computer science. I love using software to innovate and think of fun and cool ideas. Problem solving, exploring new things, and overall just expanding my knowledge on things I find interesting is a big part of who I am.</p>
        <p>At school, I'm part of the Speech and Debate team and I have made my own Computer Science club to share my knowledge and create a learning community. During my free time, I love to code and work on various side projects. When I'm not doing that, I like to play games, listen to music, and read and write books</p>
